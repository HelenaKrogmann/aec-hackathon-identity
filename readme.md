## About

## Problem Statement 

What is called a BIM model, is actually a disparate set of documents stored in different CDEs, with lots of replication.
Communicating and collaborating between stakeholders and teams requires a complex and inaccurate process involving conversions of files.

One of the biggest challenges is having a common understanding of when two documents or issues are talking about the same thing. 
In other words there is no widely-agreed upon mechanism for a project to have a central authority to identify the entities.

## Code Links 

Some of the code for the hackathon can be found as part of the Ara3D repository online at:

* https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d/tree/main/labs/Identification
* https://github.com/ara3d/ara3d/tree/main/labs/IdentificationApp

These folders contains libraries of C# functions for:

* Generating an initial identity model in JSON format
* Computing difference between two identity models as an array of JSON records 

## Other Code Written 

The following code examples have not yet been uploaded online: 

* A Python script for Revit was written by Olga Poletkina to read JSON difference records
* A Rhino plug-in was written by Ahmed Wael Imsail to generate a list of OBJs from Rhino
* A Python standalone script was written by Elia Waefle to generate a list of OBJ files and JSON parameter sets
